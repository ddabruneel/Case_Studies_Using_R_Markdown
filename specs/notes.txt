Subject: [Data Strategy] Specs for 'people capacity' dashboards with BTAD support

 

Dear Yoon,

It's taken a bit: The specs for the dashboards on data-related 'people capacity' are now attached.

It would be great to get your team's support on the data models, review together with our colleagues from the HR workstream, and then visualize.
 
Essentially, it's three priority concepts:

1) % of encumbered posts with data-focused functional titles (specialists)
2) % of staff selections with data-focused description title (specialists)
3) % of staff selections (non-specialists) with data-related content in the job description  

We look forward to supporting your team on this and make connections to other colleagues where needed.

Maybe, 1) and 2) are most straightforward to get started on?

It would be great to get something basic up by 15 April.

Please let us know if you / the team have questions.

Thank you!

Kersten
