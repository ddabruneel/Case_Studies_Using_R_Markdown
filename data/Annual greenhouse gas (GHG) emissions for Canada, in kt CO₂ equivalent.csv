"Note 1: The reporting and review requirements for GHG inventories are different for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. The definition format of data for emissions/removals from the forestry sector is different for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: Base year data in the data interface relate to the base year under the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC).  The base year under the Convention is defined slightly different than the base year under the Kyoto Protocol.  An exception is made for European Union (KP) whereby the base year under the Kyoto Protocol is displayed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 3: Some non-Annex I Parties submitted their GHG inventory data using  the format of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines in reporting GHG emissions/removals.  For this reason, these data could not be included in the data interface.  However, the data are available in the national communications (Andorra,  Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cabo Verde,  Côte d'Ivoire, Colombia, Eswatini, Ghana, Indonesia, Iran, Jamaica,  Malaysia, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Namibia, Nicaragua, Panama,  Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, Samoa, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somalia,  South Africa, Suriname, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and Viet Nam)  and biennial update reports (Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Chile,  Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, El Salvador, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Jordan,  Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico,  Mongolia, Montenegro, Namibia, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Panama, Paraguay, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Moldova,  Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Togo, Tunisia, and Uruguay).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
